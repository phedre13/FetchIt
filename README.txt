FetchIt
=======

FetchIt is a python-based scraper.  It is not intended for illegal purposes, and this is my first real project in Python.  Everything previously has been in the form of mini-scripts.  Feel free to take it, but if you do illegal things with it, then you have edited it beyond its intended purposes.
=======

About the Script:
It is intended to be run as a script and not compiled.  As a result, the behavior of it upon compiling may be more unpredictable.  FetchIt scrapes the view source of a primary page, then follows links to scrape the view source of more pages (remotecentral.com).  As of right now, the links are hard-coded to look for tv on/off hex codes for several different brands.  It currently is parsing over a thousand web pages, but as of this update, it is not quite finished.  It grabs all the way to the page numbers, parses the page numbers, and I am currently working on efficiency issues before finishing the project.  Otherwise, it will run for hours before completing, which means there is something wrong.

Have fun.  Don't get in trouble!
